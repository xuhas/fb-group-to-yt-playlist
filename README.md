# Project goal
Some friends and I have a facebook page where we post music to share with each other. The posted music are mainly links to youtube videos,
The goal of this project was to get the links of all the shared music and create a playlist in youtube.

#  How to
The python script will need a token from facebook and a token from youtube to function.
To get a token from facebook, you will need to register as a facebook dev. For youtube, you will need to register to google api.
